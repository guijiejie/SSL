# ASurveyonSelf-SupervisedLearning
This repository provides a summary of algorithms from our review paper[链接](). 

We classify self-supervised algorithms into different pretext tasks. A popular solution of SSL is to propose a pretext task for networks to solve and networks will be trained by learning objective functions of pretext tasks. The features are learned through this process.
Existing pretext tasks can be roughly classified into three categories: context based, contrastive learning (CL), and generative algorithms.
 
See our paper for more details.
